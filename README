TomatoJuice is a Time Tracker application for GNOME, based on the
Pomodoro technique. It helps you to break up your work into periods of
concentrated work and short rest periods, and also to record what you
did during the work phase.

It uses:

 * Java GNOME 
 * Akka Actors
 * MySQL

It should be generally useful as a time-tracker, but it is also
intended as an experimental piece of software to rough-out ideas which
will be used in the architecture of Palatina.
