TomatoJuice is built around an Akka actor system. We start up the
system, and create the main UI actor. All UI interactions are
translated into actor messages.

The low-level UI is Gtk+, accessed via Java-GNOME. But every logical
component of the program is wrapped by a GtkUI Facade. Methods on this
layer are coarse-grained, like "display the Note dialog" or "pop up
the status icon menu".

The UI Facade itself will be an abstract layer above the Gtk
implementation.

Above that layer, we have the UI Actors layer. Actors in this layer
will create other actors, and also call the UI Facade layer to create
the UI. Objects in the UI Facade layer will *occasionally* create
subordinate facade objects, but these will all communicate with the
same actor the first facade object was created with.

The UI Facade layer *never* creates its own actors; it will always
have been created by an actor, and will communicate back with that
actor via messages.
